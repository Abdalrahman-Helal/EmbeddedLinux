# Creating Threads in a Loop (C - Pthreads)

This project demonstrates creating multiple threads inside a loop using the **pthreads** library in C.

---

-  Create multiple threads efficiently in a loop  
-  Each thread runs the same routine  
-  Use a **mutex** to avoid race conditions on shared data  
-  Main thread synchronizes using `pthread_join`
