#bash scripiting command 

read -p -> is used to prompt the user for input on the same line.
ex:
read -p "Enter your name: " name
echo "Hello, $name!"



read -s -> the -s option with read makes the input silent — meaning it doesn’t show what the user types (useful for passwords).
ex: 
read -s -p "Enter your password: " password
echo
echo "Password entered."




set -x → turns debug mode ON
It makes the shell print each command before executing it, with all variable values expanded.
Useful for seeing what your script is actually doing step by step.

set +x → turns debug mode OFF
You use this to stop showing those trace lines.


test -f file.txt

if [ -f "./test.sh" ]
then
    echo "File Exist"
else
    echo "File Doesn't Exist"
fi

OR in one line : 
test -f "./test.sh" && echo "File Exist" || echo "File Doesn't Exist"
